Help us raise funds to create more programs and crucial resources for B.C. entrepreneurs. Please help keep Vision2Reality Foundation free for anyone, anywhere, forever.\n\nMany small businesses fail in the first few years because they lack funding, support, and knowledge. Our online community will allow new business owners to meet professionals and learn how they overcame their challenges. This is what makes us unique - we offer ongoing support, no matter where you come from; if you have a dream and a vision, we would love to help you. \n\nSince we started our community in April 2022, over 250+ members have signed up. In addition, our series of business workshops, storytelling events and mentorship programs have attracted many attendees and helped budding entrepreneurs. \n\nFor this fundraising campaign, our goal is to raise $10,000, which will be used to improve our programs. We need to attract passionate local business owners who want to share their stories and experiences to inspire others. In addition, we will need promotional material to reach more newcomers and immigrants and access better online delivery and recording applications to host and record our events, allowing more people to access our programs.\n\nHelp Us Do More\n💜\n Help Us Do More 💜\nJoin Our Family.\n\nWithout the dedication of volunteers, the passion of speakers or donations by donors and more, V2RF wouldn’t be able to be what it is today.

You resonate with your audience of aspiring leaders that building a business from scratch is undoubtedly a long journey of persistence and patience. Not only will your stories guide and motivate start-up owners, they will also remind you that you are on an ongoing business journey as well. You return the favour others have given you in the past. \n\nBecome a speaker - workshops\n\nYou are a professional with extensive knowledge in your field of business and would like to share it with aspiring business owners.

Each workshop will be guided by a theme, and through this interactive workshop, aspiring business owners can both learn from your experiences and leave with industry-relevant information and resources.  \n\nBecome a mentor\n\nPerhaps someone lent you a hand when you first started your business, and you want to give back. Mentorship allows you to do so by making an active contribution to the next generation of professionals.\n\nBecome a sponsor\n\nSponsoring an event means that you’ll be able to showcase your organization or business to more people. Sponsorship also means that you will be able to overtly show your support for our mission and values here at Vision2Reality. \n\nBecome a partner\n\nWorking with other businesses allows us to expand our own knowledge and networks!
